      "Starting in June 2021 during the lockdown, I embarked on my journey to become a software developer alone, without any teacher or mentor. At that time, I had no prior knowledge of programming. I seized the opportunity to learn something new during the lockdown, and it turned out to be an incredible journey. I have learned extensively from online resources, without taking any formal courses. Now, I specialize in React and Next.js and am capable of creating software independently.",
